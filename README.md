# diabetes-naive-bayes


This project demonstrates the use of the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on their health metrics such as glucose levels and blood pressure. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and cleaned before applying the Gaussian Naive Bayes model. The model achieves high accuracy and provides insights into the classification performance using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Features

    Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and ensures data quality.
    Naive Bayes Classifier: Implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for classification.
    Evaluation: Includes metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Usage

    Clone the repository.
    Install the required Python libraries.
    Run the script naive_bayes_diabetes.py to train and evaluate the model.

Requirements

    Python 3.7+
    Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
